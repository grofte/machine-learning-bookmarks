### Alternatives to FastAPI

All the tutorials for FastAPI are great and you can get something up and running quick but once you are past the initial stages of use the lack of API documentation and doc strings really bugs me. And it's not originally intended for machine learning.

Since DuckDB can run on top of both Parquet files and SQL databases you could probably write almost everything in DuckDB and replace a ton of Pandas and SQLAlchemy (when doing data science and analytics).

## Miscellaneous

Understanding things without code is really hard and it's even harder to use it. Papers With Code has links to Github repos where people have implemented stuff from academic papers.

[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)

You can do absolutely anything in VS Code with command variables. Next level but essential for stuff like getting the debugger to do as you want.

## Command Line Tools

### make

Good stuff, I promise.

[I know fuck all about Kubernetes but here's a comic](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic)

Docker itself is pretty straight-forward I think.
Wait, there's this.
And there was a nice NormConf talk about it.
